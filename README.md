KBase authentication server
===========================

This repo contains the second iteration of the KBase authentication server.

Build status (master):
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kbase/auth2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kbase/auth2)


Current endpoints
-----------------

### UI

UI endpoints are not versioned and not necessarily stable - behavior may change as needed to
support the auth UI.

Note that the HTML UI supplied in this repo is a minimal implementation for the purposes of
testing. In many cases a manual refresh of the page will be required to see
changes. Further, once a checkbox is manually checked or unchecked that state
will not change, even with a refresh - to see changes reset the form.

/admin  
Global admin tasks - force reset all passwords, revoke all tokens, view a token, search for users.

/admin/customroles  
View, add, and delete custom roles.

/admin/config  
View and edit the server configuration.

/admin/localaccount  
Create a local account.

/admin/user/&lt;user name&gt;  
View user, disable user, reset password, force password reset, and modify user roles.

/admin/user/&lt;user name&gt;/tokens  
View and revoke tokens for a specific user.

/customroles  
View custom roles. This page is publicly viewable to any user with a valid token.

/link  
Link accounts.

/login  
Login to a provider based account. Stores a cookie with a token.

/localaccount/login  
Login to a local account. Stores a cookie with a token.

/localaccount/reset  
Reset the password for a local account.

/logout  
Self explanatory.

/me  
User page. Update name and email address, remove roles.

/tokens  
List, create, and revoke tokens.

### API

API endpoints are versioned and behavior should not change in a backwards incompatible manner
without a change in version.

All API calls require a valid token in the `Authorization` header except legacy API endpoints,
which continue to use their original protocol. All endpoints produce JSON data unless otherwise
noted.

GET /api/V2/me  
See the current user's profile.

PUT /api/V2/me  
Update the current user's email address and display name. Takes form or JSON encoded data with the
keys `display` and `email`. Use the `Content-Type` header to specify input type.

GET /api/V2/users/?list=&lt;comma separated user names&gt;  
Validate a set of user names and get the users' display names. Returns a map of username ->
display name. Any usernames that do not correspond to accounts will not be included in the map.

GET /api/V2/users/search/&lt;prefix&gt;/?fields=&lt;comma separated fields&gt;  
Find users based on a prefix of the username or any parts of the display name, where parts are
delimited by whitespace. By default the search occurs on all fields; setting the fields query
parameter can restrict the search fields and thus possibly speed up the search. Current field names
are `username` and `displayname`; any other field names are ignored. Returns a map of
username -> display name. At most 10,000 names are returned.

GET /api/V2/token  
Introspect a token.

#### Legacy

Endpoints (mostly) identical to the original Globus and KBase auth endpoints are provided for
backwards compatibility.

POST /api/legacy/KBase/Sessions/Login  
The legacy KBase API.

GET /api/legacy/globus  
The legacy globus API. Endpoints are /goauth/token and /users.

Admin notes
-----------
* It is expected that this server always runs behind a reverse proxy (such as
  nginx) that enforces https / TLS and as such the auth server is configured to
  allow cookies to be set over insecure connections.
  * If the reverse proxy rewrites paths for the auth server, cookie path
    rewriting must be enabled for the /login and /link paths. Nginx example:

		location /auth/ {
			proxy_pass http://localhost:20002/;
			proxy_cookie_path /login /auth/login;
			proxy_cookie_path /link /auth/link;
		}

* Get Globus creds [here](https://developers.globus.org)
  * Required scopes are:
    * urn:globus:auth:scope:auth.globus.org:view_identities 
    * email
* Get Google OAuth2 creds [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis)
  * Note that the Google+ API must be enabled.

UI developer notes
------------------
* Some fields are arbitrary text entered by a user. These fields should be HTML-escaped prior to
  display. The fields are noted where they occur in the test UI. Currently the fields include:
  * Custom role descriptions
  * The reason for why a user account was enabled and disabled.
  * User display names and email addresses.
  * Token names

Requirements
------------
Java 8 (OpenJDK OK)  
Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)  
MongoDB 2.6+ (https://www.mongodb.com/)  
Jetty 9.3+ (http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.html)
    (see jetty-config.md for version used for testing)  
This repo (git clone https://github.com/kbase/auth2)  
The jars repo (git clone https://github.com/kbase/jars)  
The two repos above need to be in the same parent folder.

To start server
---------------
start mongodb  
cd into the auth2 repo  
`ant build`  
copy `deploy.cfg.example` to `deploy.cfg` and fill in appropriately  
`export KB_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG=<path to deploy.cfg>`  
`cd jettybase`  
`./jettybase$ java -jar -Djetty.port=<port> <path to jetty install>/start.jar`  

Import Globus users
------------
Use the `manage_auth` script to import Globus users - run with the `--help`
option for instructions. 

Administer the server
---------------------
Set a root password:  
`./manage_auth -d <path to deploy.cfg> -r`  

Login to a local account as `***ROOT***` with the password you set. Create a
local account and assign it the create administrator role. That account can
then be used to create further administrators (including itself) without
needing to login as root. The root account can then be disabled.

Start & stop server w/o a pid
-----------------------------
`./jettybase$ java -DSTOP.PORT=8079 -DSTOP.KEY=foo -jar ~/jetty/jetty-distribution-9.3.11.v20160721/start.jar`  
`./jettybase$ java -DSTOP.PORT=8079 -DSTOP.KEY=foo -jar ~/jetty/jetty-distribution-9.3.11.v20160721/start.jar --stop`  

Omit the stop key to have jetty generate one for you.

Running tests
-------------
* Copy `test.cfg.example` to `test.cfg` and fill in the values appropriately.
  * If it works as is start buying lottery tickets immediately.
* `ant test`
