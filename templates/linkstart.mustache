linking.

<p> You can link a new identity provider account to your currently logged-in
account, <strong>{{user}}</strong>, here. Note that some providers will
automatically redirect you back
here if you are already logged in to that provider. If the logged-in
provider account is not the account you wish to link, you must visit the
provider and logout <strong>before</strong> starting the linking process.

<p>Identity providers:<p>

{{/providers}}

{{#hasprov}}
You will be redirected to the identity provider website where you will be asked
to allow us to view your account information - your account ID, email
address, and name.<br/>
You will have 30 minutes to complete the identity provider's login process.
